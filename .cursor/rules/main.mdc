# Cursor Rule File Policy

- Every new file containing Cursor rules **must** include a clear, descriptive `description` field, following Cursor documentation standards.
- Every rule file **must** set `alwaysApply: true` to ensure rules are always enforced.
- **Existing rule files must never be deleted or disabled.** All architectural, code style, and workflow rules should remain active and versioned for the lifetime of the project.
- This policy ensures consistent, discoverable, and enforceable standards across the codebase.
