# Cursor Rule File Policy

- Every rule `**/*.mdc` should start with description block that contains 3 mandatory property: description, globs, alwaysApply
- Every rule `**/*.mdc` containing Cursor rules **must** include a clear, descriptive `description` field, following Cursor documentation standards.
- Every rule `**/*.mdc` file can have the globs instruction reducing the scope of rule usage, eg: 
  - `hooks.mdc` should be applied only to hooks, that are places in the hook folder so it should be added for all files from hook folder.
  - `code-style.mdc` should be applied only when `**/*.ts` or `**/*.tsx` files in use because it contain instruction only for those type of files.
- Every rule `**/*.mdc` file **must** set `alwaysApply: true|false` based on the logic of the file.

**Example of creating description block**
```
---
  description: Rule file to explain how to create correct rules
  globs: **/*.mdc
  alwaysApply: false
---
```


- This policy ensures consistent, discoverable, and enforceable standards across the codebase.
- Rules shouldn't conflict inside one file or from file to file.
- Before add new rule you need to read all existed rules and place requested rule to the most appropriate instruction file.
