# Design System - MANDATORY FRONTEND GUIDELINES

> **Rule Chain:**
>
> - For code conventions, see [code-style.mdc]
> - For file/folder structure, see [architecture.mdc]
> - For rapid templates and class combos, see [cursor-quick-reference.mdc]

## ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**

**BEFORE creating or updating ANY frontend functionality, you MUST follow this design system.**

## Design Philosophy

- Modern Minimalism, Dark-First, Glass Morphism, Gradient Accents, Consistent Spacing (8px grid)

## Color Palette - STRICTLY ENFORCED

- Only use the provided gray, blue, and purple palette (see code for details)

## Typography System

- Use the provided font hierarchy and always use the Typography component

## Layout Patterns

- Use the provided page structure, card, and container patterns

## Component Design

- Use the provided form field, button, and card patterns

## Interactive Elements

- Use the provided hover, focus, loading, and disabled state patterns

## Animation & Transitions

- Use the provided transition and animation classes

## Responsive Design

- Use the provided breakpoints and responsive patterns

## Accessibility Guidelines

- Use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and ensure color contrast

## Implementation Patterns

- For code conventions, see [code-style.mdc]
- For templates and class combos, see [cursor-quick-reference.mdc]

## Spacing Scale & Breakpoints

- Use the 8px grid system and provided breakpoints

## ðŸš¨ **ENFORCEMENT CHECKLIST**

- Only use colors from the palette
- Use proper font hierarchy and Typography component
- Use 8px grid system
- Use established card and container patterns
- Use established form field, button, and card patterns
- Implement proper focus states, ARIA labels, and contrast ratios
- Test on mobile and desktop
- Use consistent transition durations (200-300ms)
- Implement proper loading states for async operations
- Include proper error handling and user feedback

**REMEMBER**: This design system is MANDATORY for all frontend development. Non-compliance will result in code rejection.
