# Committing Rule

> **Rule Chain:**
>
> - For full workflow and scripts, see [development-workflow.mdc]

- Each commit must have a descriptive, short message summarizing the changes made.
- The character limit is 100 symbols
- The commit message should be clear, concise, and reflect the actual modifications (e.g., "fix: correct login validation error message" or "refactor: split Navbar into separate components").
- If a pre-commit hook throws any errors (e.g., lint, type-check, formatting, empty files/folders, unused variables), these errors must be fixed before the commit is finalized.
- After fixing errors, re-stage and re-commit the changes with an updated message if necessary.
- Never bypass or disable pre-commit hooks.
- Empty files and folders are not allowed in commits.
- Unused variables, imports, and parameters must be removed before committing.
- The commit history should remain clean and meaningful for future maintainers.
